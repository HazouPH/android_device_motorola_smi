Intel End User License Agreement
(Version November 2013)

1.	LICENSE DEFINITIONS: 

A.	"Materials" are defined as the software, documentation, license key codes (if applicable) and other 
materials, including any updates and upgrade thereto, that are provided to you under this 
Agreement.  Materials also include the Redistributables.

B.	"Redistributables" are the following files:
libsvml_pcg.a, 
libirc_pcg.a, 
libpcg.a, 
libpcg_host.a
 
2.	LICENSE GRANT:

A.	Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel Corporation ("Intel") grants to you 
a non-exclusive, non- transferable, copyright license to make only the minimum number of copies of 
the Materials reasonably necessary for your internal use. 

B.	Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, 
non- transferable, fully-paid copyright license to distribute the Redistributables only when statically 
linked as part of your products or applications.  

C.	Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants you a non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable license under Intel’s Licensed Patent Claims to make copies of the 
Materials internally and use the Materials internally only. "Licensed Patent Claims" means the claims 
of Intel's patents that are necessarily and directly infringed by the rights authorized in Section 2A 
above, when the Materials are in their unmodified form as delivered by Intel to you and not modified, 
or combined with anything else.  Licensed Patent Claims are only those claims which Intel can 
license without paying, or obtaining the consent of, a third party.

3.	LICENSE CONDITIONS:

A.	Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may use contractors to exercise 
your license grants above provided such contractors (i) agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, 
(ii) use the Materials solely for developing, testing and/or supporting your products and applications 
(“Service”), (iii) either return to you or destroy all copies of the Materials in their possession upon the 
completion of the Service. 

B.	You may NOT:  (i) use, copy, distribute, or publicly display the Materials except as provided in this 
Agreement; (ii) rent or lease the Materials to any third party; (iii) assign this Agreement or transfer 
the Materials without the express written consent of Intel; (iv) modify, adapt, or translate the 
Materials in whole or in part except as provided in this Agreement; (v) reverse engineer, decompile, 
or disassemble the Materials; (vi) attempt to modify or tamper with the normal function of a license 
manager that regulates usage of the Materials; (vii) distribute, sublicense or transfer the Source 
Code form of any components of the Materials or derivatives thereof to any third party except as 
provided in this Agreement; (viii) distribute Redistributables except as part of a larger program that 
adds significant primary functionality different from that of the Redistributables; (ix) modify or 
distribute the Source Code of any Redistributable so that any part of it becomes subject to an 
Excluded License.  An “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification, 
or distribution, that the licensed software or other software incorporated into, derived from or 
distributed with such software (a) be disclosed or distributed in Source Code form; (b) be licensed 
by the user to third parties for the purpose of making and/or distributing derivative works; or (c) be 
redistributable at no charge.  Open source software includes, without limitation, software licensed or 
distributed under any of the following licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution 
models substantially similar to any of the following: (a) GNU’s General Public License (GPL) or 
Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL), (b) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL), (c) the Mozilla Public License, (d) 
the Netscape Public License, (e) the Sun Community Source License (SCSL), (f) the Sun Industry 
Source License (SISL), and (g) the Common Public License (CPL).

C.	DISTRIBUTION:  Distribution of the Redistributables is also subject to the following limitations:  You 
(i) shall be solely responsible to your customers for any update or support obligation or other liability 
which may arise from the distribution, (ii) shall not make any statement that your product is 
"certified", or that its performance is guaranteed, by Intel, (iii) shall not use Intel's name or 
trademarks to market your product without written permission, (iv) shall use a license agreement 
that prohibits disassembly and reverse engineering of the Redistributables, (v) shall indemnify, hold 
harmless, and defend Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including 
attorney's fees, that arise or result from your distribution of any product.

4.	COPYRIGHT: Title to the Materials, modifications thereto provided by Intel and all copies thereof remain 
with Intel or its suppliers.  The Materials are protected by intellectual property rights, including without 
limitation, United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  You will not remove any 
copyright or other proprietary notice from the Materials.  You agree to prevent any unauthorized copying 
of the Materials.  Except as expressly provided herein, no license or right is granted to you directly or by 
implication, inducement, estoppel or otherwise; specifically Intel does not grant any express or implied 
right to you under Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets.

5.	NO WARRANTY, NO SUPPORT AND LIMITED REPLACEMENT:  THE MATERIALS AND 
INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. INTEL 
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,  
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY WARRANTY OTHERWISE 
ARISING OUT OF ANY PROPOSAL, SPECIFICATION, OR SAMPLE.  If the media on which the 
Materials are furnished are found to be defective in material or workmanship under normal use for a 
period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt, Intel's entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall 
be the replacement of the media.  This offer is void if the media defect results from accident, abuse, or 
misapplication.

Intel may make changes to the Materials, or to items referenced therein, at any time without notice, but 
is not obligated to support, update or provide training for the Materials. Intel may in its sole discretion 
offer such support, update or training services under separate terms at Intel’s then-current rates. You 
may request additional information on Intel’s service offerings from an Intel sales representative.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  NEITHER INTEL NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR 
OTHER LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF 
INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  BECAUSE SOME 
JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.

7.	UNAUTHORIZED USE:  THE MATERIALS ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED, OR AUTHORIZED 
FOR USE IN ANY TYPE OF SYSTEM OR APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE 
MATERIALS COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH MAY OCCUR 
(e.g.,  MEDICAL SYSTEMS, LIFE SUSTAINING OR LIFE SAVING SYSTEMS).  Should you use the 
Materials for any such unintended or unauthorized use, you hereby indemnify, defend, and hold Intel 
and its officers, subsidiaries and affiliates harmless against all claims, costs, damages, and expenses, 
and reasonable attorney fees arising out of, directly or indirectly, such use and any claim of product 
liability, personal injury or death associated with such unintended or unauthorized use, even if such 
claim alleges that Intel was negligent regarding the design or manufacture of the Materials.

8.	USER SUBMISSIONS:  This Agreement does not obligate you to provide Intel with materials, 
information, comments, suggestions or other communication regarding the Materials.  However, you 
agree that any material, information, comments, suggestions or other communication you transmit or 
post to an Intel website (including but not limited to, submissions to the Intel Premier Support and/or 
other customer support websites or online portals) or provide to Intel under this Agreement related to the 
features, functions, performance or use of the Materials are deemed non-confidential and non-
proprietary ("Communications").  Intel will have no obligations with respect to the Communications.  You 
hereby grant to Intel a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, copyright license to copy, 
modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license and sublicense through 
multiple tiers of distribution and licensees, incorporate and otherwise use the Communications and all 
data, images, sounds, text, and other things embodied therein, including derivative works thereto, for 
any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to 
or from an Intel website or provide to Intel any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, 
pornographic, or other material that would violate any law.  If you wish to provide Intel with information 
that you intend to be treated as confidential information, Intel requires that such confidential information 
be provided pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), so please contact your Intel 
representative to ensure the proper NDA is in place.

Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from reviewing your Communications 
and errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing your Communications. Furthermore, 
nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing Intel from implementing independently-
developed enhancements to Intel’s own error diagnosis methodology to detect errors or defects in Intel 
products discovered while reviewing your Communications or to implement bug fixes or enhancements 
in Intel products. The foregoing may include the right to include your Communications in regression test 
suites. 

9.	CONSENT.  You agree that Intel, its subsidiaries or suppliers may collect and use technical and related 
information, including but not limited to technical information about your computer, system and 
application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software 
updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Materials, and to verify 
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  Intel may use this information, as long as it is in a form 
that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to develop and provide services or 
technologies to you.

10.	TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE: This Agreement becomes effective on the date you accept this 
Agreement and will continue until terminated as provided for in this Agreement.  If you are using the 
Materials under the control of a time-limited license, for example an Evaluation License, this Agreement 
terminates without notice on the last day of the time period, which is specified in the Materials, and/or 
controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  Intel may terminate this license immediately if you 
are in breach of any of its terms and conditions and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of 
written notice from Intel.  Upon termination, you will immediately return to Intel or destroy the Materials 
and all copies thereof.  In the event of termination of this Agreement, the license grant to any 
Redistributables distributed by you in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior 
to the effective date of such termination, shall survive any such termination of this Agreement

11.	U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS: The technical data and computer software covered by 
this license is a “Commercial Item,” as such term is defined by the FAR 2.101 (48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is 
“commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as specified under 
FAR 12.212 (48 C.F.R. 12.212) or DFARS 227.7202 (48 C.F.R. 227.7202), as applicable. This 
commercial computer software and related documentation is provided to end users for use by and on 
behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to 
the terms and conditions herein. Use for or on behalf of the U.S. Government is permitted only if the 
party acquiring or using this software is properly authorized by an appropriate U.S. Government official. 
This use by or for the U.S. Government clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or 
other provision that addresses Government rights in the computer software or documentation covered 
by this license.  All copyright licenses granted to the U.S. Government are coextensive with the technical 
data and computer software licenses granted herein. The U.S. Government shall only have the right to 
reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and prepare derivative works as needed to implement those 
rights.

12.	GENERAL PROVISIONS

A.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This Agreement is intended to be the entire agreement between you and 
Intel with respect to matters contained herein, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
agreements and negotiations with respect to those matters.  No waiver of any breach or default shall 
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.  If any provision of this Agreement is 
determined by a court to be unenforceable, you and Intel will deem the provision to be modified to 
the extent necessary to allow it to be enforced to the extent permitted by law, or if it cannot be 
modified, the provision will be severed and deleted from this Agreement, and the remainder of the 
Agreement will continue in effect.  Any change, modification or waiver to this Agreement must be in 
writing and signed by an authorized representative of you and an officer (or delegate) of Intel, and 
must specifically identify this Agreement by its title (e.g., “End User License Agreement for the 
[Replace w/name] ”) and version, i.e., November 2013).

B.	GOVERNING LAW: Any claim arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the 
internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.  
You agree that the terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do 
not apply to this Agreement.  All disputes and litigation arising out of or related to this Agreement, 
including without limitation matters connected with its performance, shall be subject to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal courts sitting therein. Each Party 
hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably waives all 
objections to such venue. 

C.	EXPORT LAWS: You acknowledge that the Materials and all related technical information or 
materials is subject to export controls under the laws and regulations of the United States and any 
other applicable governments. You agree to comply with these laws and regulations governing 
export, re-export, import, transfer, distribution, and use of the Materials and all related technical 
information or materials. In particular, but without limitation, the Materials and all related technical 
information or materials may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries 
or (b) to any person or entity listed on a denial order published by the U.S. government or any other 
applicable governments. By using Materials  and all related technical information or materials, you 
represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also 
agree that you will not use the Materials  and all related technical information or materials for any 
purposes prohibited by the U.S. government or other applicable governments’ laws, including, 
without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missile, chemical 
or biological weapons. You confirm that the Materials and all related technical information or 
materials will not be re-exported or sold to a third party who is known or suspected to be involved in 
activities including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of 
nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weapons. You agree that the Materials and all related 
technical information or materials subject to control under defense laws and regulations (e.g., the
